**Challenge Friends** - not implemented yet.

## 3. Battles

Battles are turn-based. Each pokemon knows 4 attacks at a time, that can be changed as it levels up or from special items. Attacks have various effects, from poisoning the target, to hiding in the ground, to launching massive hyper beams. Once a pokemon loses all its HP, it is out of battle. A battle lasts as long as there are pokemons remaining in your team able to fight.

Items can be used during battles: for example, you can boost your pokemon's HP, cure its burns or even throw pokeballs to catch the enemy pokemon, only if it is a wild one.

## 4. Pokemons

**What is new?** A pokemon needs special care. You will need to play with him, even feed him. He needs to win battles in order to avoid having trust issues, which make his battle capacity lower. For example, your main pokemon (the one you start each battle with) will trust you more, so try not to focus on a single pokemon. Also, avoid letting your pokemons faint, lose battles, because they will become anxious.

## 5. Mini-games

There are brand new ways to play with your pokemons! There are mini-games, designed to increase (or decrease, if your score is negative) your pokemon's happiness! A happy pokemon is a strong pokemon!
